1️⃣ State Definition (FSM)

You actually need 10 states (Green + Yellow for each direction):

N_G  → N_Y →
E_G  → E_Y →
S_G  → S_Y →
W_G  → W_Y → back to N_G


Rule:

If a direction is active, it can be Green or Yellow

All other directions = Red

Default/reset state = All Red

2️⃣ Timing Logic
Light	Duration
Green	16 sec
Yellow	4 sec

Use a counter:

count < 16 → stay in Green

count < 4 → stay in Yellow

When time over → count = 0 and move to next state

3️⃣ FSM Design (Two Blocks) ✅

You did the right approach.

🔹 Block 1: State Transition (Sequential)

Clock driven

Uses count

Moves between states

🔹 Block 2: Output Logic (Combinational)

Decides light colors based on state

4️⃣ State Encoding (Example)
typedef enum logic [3:0] {
  ALL_RED,
  N_G, N_Y,
  E_G, E_Y,
  S_G, S_Y,
  W_G, W_Y
} state_t;

7️⃣ Simple Logic (Your Line Explained)

“If North (check count, wait 16 sec, then rst & move to NY, then wait 4 sec)”

✔️ That is exactly correct FSM behavior
✔️ Interview-ready explanation
✔️ Clean separation of timing + state + output

8️⃣ What You Should Say in Viva / Interview 🎯

“I designed a Moore FSM with separate state-transition and output logic.
Each direction has a Green and Yellow state.
Green lasts 16 seconds, Yellow lasts 4 seconds, and all other lights remain Red.
A counter controls state transitions.”
